# PuzzlerVR
VR Mobile Puzzler app
Introduction:
As a part of the VR Developer Nanodegree course at Udacity, I have created a mobile virtual reality application ‘Puzzler’ by using 
different development techniques like design, iteration and user testing. To complete the game successfully user has to click on the
right orbs that are shown by the pattern in the dungeon.

Considerations:
Designed based on keeping the end user in mind, scaling mechanism, motion smoothness, audio and visual mood of the scene. From these, 
user can feel more comfortable and can understand the way of playing game in an easier way on their mobile phones.

Puzzler — Outcomes:
This application built for android users and it gives a better experience for the users on a VR headset. It has been built by using 
iterative approach and also by taking several considerations from the test user. These two techniques have helped in the improvement 
of the game to get a better experience by the end user.
